  <h1>Moon</h1>

  <p>The Moon, Earth's steadfast celestial companion, is a silent witness to the passage of time and the evolution of
    its planetary partner. Formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago, likely from the debris of a colossal collision between
    Earth and a Mars-sized protoplanet, the Moon is both a relic of violence and a symbol of cosmic tranquility. With a
    diameter of 3,474 kilometers—roughly one-quarter the size of Earth—it is an unyielding, cratered sphere of regolith
    and rock. Its barren surface tells a story written in the scars of ancient asteroid impacts, each marking a chapter
    in the solar system's tumultuous history.<br><br>Forever locked in synchronous rotation with Earth, the Moon shows only
    one face to its host—a face that has inspired countless myths, poems, and scientific inquiries. It wields subtle yet
    profound influence, driving Earth's tides and stabilizing its axial tilt, which in turn governs the planet's
    seasons. With no atmosphere to speak of, the Moon endures harsh extremes, from searing sunlight to freezing
    darkness, a stark contrast to Earth's life-sustaining environment.<br><br>Despite its desolation, the Moon has
    captivated humanity for millennia. It served as a beacon for early navigation, a muse for dreamers, and ultimately,
    a stepping stone for human exploration. The Apollo missions turned the Moon from a distant enigma into a place
    humans have walked, though its mysteries still beckon us back. A silent sentinel orbiting 384,400 kilometers away,
    the Moon is more than Earth's satellite—it is its partner in a celestial waltz, a pale and enduring reminder of our
    place in the universe.</p>
