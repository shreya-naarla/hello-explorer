    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <p>Earth's steadfast sidekick and occasional nightlight, the Moon is a barren, pockmarked poet of the cosmos, waxing and waning with theatrical flair. Forever locked in a one-sided gaze with its planetary partner, it influences tides, inspires art, and adds a dash of celestial drama to the night sky. A relic of cosmic violence, the Moon boasts a crusty exterior rich in ancient tales of asteroid collisions, silently orbiting as both Earth's guardian and its quiet muse.</p>
