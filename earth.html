    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>A cosmic kaleidoscope of life and chaos, Earth is a temperamental third-born in the solar family, balancing its rocky demeanor with a liquid heart and a gaseous veil. This blue-green marvel spins with just enough grace to sustain 8.7 million species, while its tectonic plates cha-cha over a molten mantle, occasionally throwing tantrums as earthquakes. Powered by the Sun's relentless energy and governed by an inexplicably perfect Goldilocks zone, Earth is both a cradle for life and a reminder of how fragile that life can be.</p>
